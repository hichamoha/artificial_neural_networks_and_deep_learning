### Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning

This repository provides an introduction to the field of Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning. It covers the most common models in artificial neural networks with a focus on the multi-layer perceptron. The repo also provides an introduction to deep learning. The material are based on the following book:
Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville: \textit{Deep Learning}. An HTLM version of the book is available at \url{https://www.deeplearningbook.org/}

The main topics included are the following:

#### Feed-forward neural networks
The simple perceptron and the multi-layer perceptron, choice of suitable error functions and techniques to minimize them, how to detect and avoid overtraining, ensembles of neural networks and techniques to create them, Bayesian training of multi-layer perceptrons 

#### Recurrent neural networks
Simple recurrent networks and their use in time series analysis, fully recurrent for both time series analysis and associative memories (Hopfield model), the simulated annealing optimization technique 

#### Self-organizing neural networks
Networks that can extract principal components, networks for data clustering, learning vector quantization (LVQ), self-organizing feature maps (SOFM) 

#### Deep learning 
Overview of deep learning, convolutional neural networks for classification of images, different techniques to avoid overtraining in deep networks, techniques to pre-train deep networks
